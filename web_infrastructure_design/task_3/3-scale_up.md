# Scaled Up Web Infrastructure

## Overview
This document describes a scaled-up web infrastructure designed to host the website www.foobar.com with improved performance, resilience, and separation of concerns. This architecture builds upon previous designs by implementing dedicated servers for each component and adding redundancy through load balancing.

## Infrastructure Diagram
The accompanying Mermaid diagram (`3-scale_up.mmd`) illustrates the complete infrastructure setup with separated components across multiple servers, clustered for high availability.

## Components

### 1. Load Balancer Cluster (HAproxy)
- **Purpose**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers while providing fault tolerance
- **Configuration**: Active-active setup for high availability
- **Function**: Ensures no single point of failure at traffic distribution level
- **Benefits**: Improves reliability and allows for maintenance without downtime

### 2. Web Server Servers (Nginx)
- **Role**: Dedicated machines for handling HTTP requests and serving static content
- **Separation**: Isolated from application logic
- **Benefits**: 
  - Optimized performance for web serving tasks
  - Independent scaling based on traffic patterns
  - Enhanced security through separation

### 3. Application Server Servers
- **Purpose**: Dedicated machines for running application code and business logic
- **Functionality**: Process dynamic content requests
- **Benefits**:
  - Focused resource allocation for application processing
  - Isolated environment for code execution
  - Independent scaling based on computational needs

### 4. Database Cluster (MySQL)
- **Configuration**: Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) setup on dedicated servers
- **Distribution**: Separate machines for database operations
- **Benefits**:
  - Optimized for database workloads
  - Independent scaling of database resources
  - Improved data security through isolation

## Architectural Decisions

### Server Splitting Strategy
- **Component Isolation**: Each major function operates on dedicated hardware
- **Rationale**: 
  - Prevents resource contention between different types of workloads
  - Allows for targeted scaling based on specific bottlenecks
  - Simplifies maintenance and troubleshooting

### Clustering and High Availability
- **Implementation**: Redundant components with load balancing
- **Design Philosophy**: Eliminate single points of failure
- **Benefits**: 
  - Enhanced reliability during hardware failures
  - Supports rolling updates without downtime
  - Better handling of traffic spikes

## Performance Optimizations
- **Resource Allocation**: Tailored hardware specifications for each server role
- **Caching Strategy**: Distributed caching across the infrastructure
- **Traffic Management**: Intelligent routing based on request types

## Security Measures
- **Network Segmentation**: Internal networks separated by function
- **Access Control**: Restricted communication paths between components
- **Monitoring**: Component-specific security monitoring

## Scalability Approach
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more servers to distribute load
- **Vertical Scaling**: Upgrading resources on specific servers as needed
- **Modular Growth**: Ability to expand specific components independently

## Next Steps and Further Improvements
- Implementation of content delivery network (CDN)
- Disaster recovery setup across multiple data centers
- Container orchestration for dynamic scaling
- Database sharding for improved data distribution
