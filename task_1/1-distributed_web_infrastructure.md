Load Balancer (HAProxy):

Routes HTTP/HTTPS requests to backend servers.

Can perform health checks and distribute traffic evenly.

Nginx:

Acts as a reverse proxy to the application server on the same machine.

Can handle SSL termination and static content.

App Server:

Runs your backend logic (e.g., Flask, Express, Django).

Connected directly to MySQL for data persistence.

MySQL Databases:

Each server has its own MySQL instance. For production:

Use replication (Master-Slave or Master-Master).

Or, use a dedicated DB cluster (e.g., MySQL Group Replication, Galera Cluster).

Scalability:

This design works for small-scale deployments.

For growth, separate the database onto its own cluster or managed service (like Amazon RDS).
